## Limited Dependent Variables 

- Broadly defined as a *dependent* variable whose range of values is *substantively restricted*:

	- it is *dependent* ==> variable to be explained (usually the $y$)
	- it is *restricted* 

---
## The most common restrictions are:

- **Binary** : $Y \in \{0,1\}$  (e.g. Yes/No variables)
- **Multinomial**:  $Y \in \{0,1,2, ... ,k\}$  (e.g. multiple choices variables)
- **Integer**: $Y \in \{0,1,2, ... \}$  (e.g. count variables)
- **Censored**:  $Y \in \{ Y^*, Y^* \geq 0 \}$  (e.g. use of fertilizer by farmers, wages)
			
---
## Business as usual? 

- When  y is restricted
- Using Linear Regression can still be done

$$y_i = \beta_0 + X_i\beta + \varepsilon_i \text{ where y is LDV}$$

---
## But leads to biases and problems

- Other types of models are developed
- Several models depending on the type of the LDV considered
- For this class: *Binary Dependent Variable* (**Logit**, **Probit** models)

- Different names:

  - **binary**, or **dichotomous** , or **dummy** 

---

## Binary Variables as Explained Variable

- The explained variable is either $0$ or $1$ 

  - Example: Participation in the labor force (**Labor**) explained by **Age**, **Gender**, and **Education*
  - Person is either in the labor force or not --> *yes* or *no* decision
  
  $$Labor_i = \beta_0 + \beta_a Age_i + \beta_g Gender_i + \beta_e Education_i $$

---

$$Labor_i = \beta_0 + Age_i\beta_a + Gender_i\beta_g + Education_i\beta_e $$

Note there are two binary variables: $Labor_i$ and $Gender_i$. 
The models is LDV because $Labor_i$ is binary, not because $Gender_i$ is binary  

<p class="fragment">For example, if $Income_i$ is a continuous variable, following model is not a BDV:
$$Income_i = \beta_0 + \beta_a Age_i + \beta_g Gender_i + \beta_e Education_i $$
