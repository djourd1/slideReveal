### Type of variable?
Farmers' decision to use pesticides or not, is
        
- [x] Binary 
- [ ] Count 
- [ ] Multinomial
- [ ] Corner solution
- [ ] Continuous
        
        
### Which model will I use?
       
When modeling farmers' decision to use pesticides or notes
       
> Several models could be used
        
- [x] Logit model
- [x] Probit model
- [ ] Tobit model
- [ ] Poisson model
- [x] Linear regression model
        
### Which model will I use?
        
When modeling farmers' area dedicated to a new crop/technique
        
> Several models could be used
        
- [ ] Logit model
- [ ] Probit model
- [x] Tobit model
- [ ] Poisson model
- [x] Linear regression model
        
        
### What type of variable? 
        
The number of injuries per year for farm workers.
        
> These are plain (integer) values, but we do not know how many values we can expect
        
1. [ ] Binary 
1. [x] Count 
1. [ ] Multinomial
1. [ ] Corner solution
1. [ ] Continuous
        
        
### What type of variable? 
        
The number of new technologies employed by a farmer
        
> These are plain (integer) values, but we do not know how many values we can expect
        
1. [ ] Binary 
1. [x] Count 
1. [ ] Multinomial
1. [ ] Corner solution
1. [ ] Continuous
        
### What type of model will I use? 

Adopted = beta + beta1 Education + beta_2 Gender
<br>
Where adopted = 0 or 1, education = no of school years, Gender = 0 if male, 1 if female
        
> The dependent variable is continuous
        
- [x] Logit 
- [x] Probit
- [x] Linear Regression Model
- [ ] Tobit
- [ ] Poisson
        
### What type of model will I use? 
        
Income = \beta + \beta_1 Education + \beta_2 Gender 
<br>

Where Income is continuous, education = no of school years, Gender = 0 if male, 1 if female
        
> The dependent variable is continuous
        
- [ ] Logit 
- [ ] Probit
- [x] Linear Regression Model
- [ ] Tobit
- [ ] Poisson
